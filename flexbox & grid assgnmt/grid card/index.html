            <p><strong>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
                in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth. </strong><br><br>
              
                “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
                for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

            <p><strong>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</strong><br><br><br>

                “ Before joining the bootcamp, <br> I’ve never written a lineof code. I needed some<br> structure from 
                professionals who can help me learn<br> programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                student <br>of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and<br> staff 
                did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I <br>never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                project,<br> in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next <br>level in a way that no tutorial 
                could ever have.<br> In fact, I’ve often referred to it <br>during interviews as an example of my developent 
                experience. <br> certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer<br> after receiving multiple offers. 
                100% recommend! ”</p>
